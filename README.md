# ID-Card-Detection
Problem: We want to solve a problem that occurs at buildings/companiesâ€™ receptions. Currently, a receptionist needs to input all the information manually and it takes a long time.
Visitors need to wait for a long time and sometimes it creates a long queue in front of the reception. 
We want to build a visitor sign-in system (visitor sign-in system) for company receptions. 
This system takes a photo of the Visitor's Photo ID card by a tablet placed on the reception and extracts the following information to identify the visitor.


- before running the notebook ake sure you upload the ID image on your google drive, connect the drive and set the path of the image.
